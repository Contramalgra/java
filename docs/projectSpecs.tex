and the commented version saved separately, also leaving a copy of the original.
\end {itemize}
\subsubsection{Test Code Activities}
The Test Suite will compile and run code assignments through the submitted tests,
then present the outputs side by side with the sample correct outputs.

\section{Role - The TA/TM Markers \label{Marker}}
\subsection{Grade Activities}
The same as the Grade Activities section \ref {grading} under the Instructor.
A TA/TM has access to and only to the assignments of the groups or students they
have been assigned, for both grading and regrading.

\section{The Login System}
\subsection{Failed Logins \label{loginSystem1}}
Users are granted five attempts to log in successfully.  If they incorrectly
enter their password all five times, their account is locked and they must reset
their password with the system administrator before they can login again.
\subsection{Password Resets \label{loginSystem2}}
If a user wants to reset their own password(without the help of the System
Administrator) they may ask the system to reset their password.  The system will
send a randomly generated password to their email that they can use to login
until they choose to change their own password.

\section{The Database}
\subsection{Content}
The database is responsible for storing:
\begin{itemize}
\item User Accounts
\item Courses
\item Activities
\item Rubrics
\item Grades
\end{itemize}

\section{Logs}

	Username of user \newline Password of user \newline Enter button \newline Forgot 
	Password button & If user enters correct username and password, they will be sent 
	to their respective home screen. \newline If the user selects the forgotten password 
	option they will be sent to a screen with a process for resetting passwords. & Upon 
	hitting enter, an error will be displayed if the username and password are not valid.
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Description}
The login will be the first screen shown upon opening the program. The login screen 
satisfies the separation of the functional requirements by role, as well as the
password locking after failed attempts and password resetting as specified in
sections \ref{loginSystem1} and \ref{loginSystem2} on page \pageref{loginSystem1}.

\section{Activity Marking}
\begin{tabular}{| p{5cm} | p{5cm} | p{5cm} |}

	Inputs & Outputs & Data Displayed \\ \hline
	Beside each entry will be an
	area for the Marker to add a grade for that part of the rubric.
	The user can insert comments directly into student work.
	There will be a button available to deliver a commented copy of the working
assignment back to the student.
	& All entries for the rubric will be shown.
Total grade will be calculated based on the above entries and shown at the
bottom.
	& The student work will be visible beside the rubric and grade entry areas.
	
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Description}
This screen allows users with Marking privileges to grade student activities
as described in section \ref{grading} on page \pageref{grading}.\\
The user navigates here from \textbf{Course Choice} then \textbf{Activity Choice}.

\section{Account Creation/Modification}
\begin{tabular}{| p{5cm} | p{5cm} | p{5cm} |}

in section \ref{Account Creation} on page \pageref{Account Creation}.
	& After checking to ensure that all fields are filled out, the user is 
	prompted with a confirmation of the fields. 
	& As soon as the user chooses confirm, the System Admin page is displayed.
	
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Description}
The same screen is used for modifying an account. The only difference is
that the fields are filled with the previous data of the existing account.

\section{Course Creation}
\begin{tabular}{| p{5cm} | p{5cm} | p{5cm} |}
	\hline
	Inputs & Outputs & Data Displayed \\ \hline
	There will be fields open to the user to input the neccessary information described
in section \ref{courseCreation} on page \pageref{courseCreation}.
	& The output will return
the user back to the course management system for other options.
	& The user's currently entered course data as well as a confirmation that the course
	has been created
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Description}

	\\Activities being created from scratch will have each field empty & &
	\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Description}
Both activity creation and modification share virtually the same screen.
When an option would not be applicable for the activity, such as test input and
output files for non-programming activities, the field will not be shown.
This screen satisfies the requirements \ref{CreateAct} and \ref{ModifyAct} for
an Instructor to create and modify activities.

\section{Scenarios}
\subsection{Grade and Save Changes}
Instructor Lee logs in, navigates to his Marking tab, then selects the course MATH 151.
He selects the student Mary‚Äôs submission for Homework 3, which was a series of multiple
choice math questions. He checks Mary‚Äôs submitted answers side-by-side with the solutions.
There were 20 questions worth 1 point each and Mary had 18 correct, so Instructor
Lee enters 18 into the points received portion of the rubric. He then clicks Save to update
the database, and it saves successfully.

\subsection{Grade and Discard Changes}
TA Jane logs in, navigates to her marking tab, then selects the course PHIL 100. She
selects the student Bill‚Äôs submission for Essay 2. The pdf of the essay is opened and
its rubric is shown beside it. Halfway through marking the essay and having already
filled in the marks for half of the rubric‚Äôs criteria, Jane realizes she had been repeatedly
misreading some key words and it changed the meaning of most of the essay. She decides
to regrade the entire essay, so she clicks on Discard Changes. A dialogue window pops
up that asks ‚ÄúYou are going to discard changes. All unsaved changes will be lost. Are you
sure you want to continue?‚Äù with the options yes and no. She chooses yes and all the
changes she made to the rubric were reset. She now still has the same view, but the
rubric is back to its initial state with no marks entered.

\subsection{Comment on Code and Save Changes}
Instructor Lee logs in, navigates to his Marking tab, then selects the course CMPT 120.
He selects the student Ned‚Äôs submission for Code Assignment 4, which is a short Java
program. The code submission is presented in a text-editable box and the rubric is shown
beside it. As he is marking, Instructor Lee notices some portions of the code could have
been written more efficiently, so he enters a Java comment directly into the code which
suggests a possible improvement. He clicks Save which saves all the marks he had input
into the rubric, and also saves the updated code with his comments. A copy of the student‚Äôs
original submission still exists, but there is now also a copy which includes Instructor Lee‚Äôs
comments. Instructor Lee‚Äôs view is now still of the commented submission and the rubric with
the marks that have already been entered.
