\section{Role - The Academic Administrator}
\subsection{The Power of the Academic Admin}
The Academic Admin does not have any jurisdiction over the role of System Administrator.
The Academic Administrator role assumes all functions of and can change/update any material
provided by the following users:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Assistant Academic Administrators
  \item Instructors
  \item TA/TMs
\end{itemize}

\section{Role - The Assistant Academic Administrator}

\section{Role - The Instructor}

\section{Role - The Ta/Tm Markers}

\section{The Login System}

\section{The Database}

\section{Logs}
There are two distinct types of logs: Academic Logs and System Logs.
\subsection{Academic Logs}
The academic log contains all records of additions and changes to the academic records.
The academic log documents grade and assignment modifications.  The academic log
is visible to every user excluding the Ta/Tm marker.
\subsection{System Logs}
The system log contains a record of the systems tasks.  It documents user sign-ins
and system backup times. The system log is only visible to the System Administrator.

\part{Non-functional Requirements}
\section{Quality}
\subsection{Usability}
The application should be usable to all relevant university staff
regardless of computer experience.
\subsection{Accessibility}
\subsubsection{Valid Users}
Only users who have created an account with the System Administrator will be able
to use the application. Users will not be able to log in with their normal
university username and password.
\subsubsection{Availability Hours}
The system should be accessible at any time of day, except during backup times.
\subsection{Performance}
\subsubsection{Maximum Load}
The client has specified that up to 20 users might use the system during
peak times, thus the system should aim for no slow-down for up to \textbf{40 users.}
\subsection{Maintenance}
\subsubsection{Application Life Span}
The client has not indicated how long they plan to use the system once developed.
\subsubsection{Addition of Features}
The client has not requested a desire for the addition of new
features post release.

\section{Constraints}
\subsection{Platform}
The application will run on the Windows desktop.
\subsection{Implementation}
\subsubsection{Language}
The application will be written in Java using the Swing library for its GUI.
\subsubsection{Development Environment}
Eclipse?
\subsubsection{Version Control}
The source code will be managed via a software version control system.
\subsection{External Resources}
\subsubsection{SQL Database}
The application will store user and grading data on an MS SQL server located on
the university campus, and thus the user's computer must have a network connection.
\subsection{Licensing}
\subsubsection{Closed Source}
The application will be closed source under the Donnervögel Draconian License.
\subsubsection{GPL Incompatibility}
No libraries with GPL licensing will be included in the system.

\section{Other Requirements}

User accounts may only be created through the System Administrator.
